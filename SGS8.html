            <h3> Samsung S8 was labeled another milestone for Samsung because of its improved design and added features. Stated by <a href="https://www.pocket-lint.com/phones/reviews/samsung/140650-samsung-galaxy-s8-review-a-mobile-masterpiece"> pocket-lint</a>  
            that “the Samsung Galaxy S8 is a masterpiece; 
            one with a few brushstrokes out of place, but a masterpiece nonetheless.” Some of the good things about this phone were: 
        <ul>
        <li>The most eye-catching phone design you can buy today </li>
        
        <li>Great-looking 18.5:1 aspect ratio AMOLED screen is ideal for entertainment (even more so when HDR comes into play) </li>
        
        <li>Best Samsung software experience to date </li>
        
        <li>Decent battery life and optimizations </li>
        
        <li>The rear camera is excellent </li>
        </ul>
            The S8 was also one of the first phones to introduce Infinity Display, that referred to the fact it had an edge-to-edge display with virtually no bezels. 
        The design of the S8 was liked by many and most people really liked the lackluster Bixby features at launch, 
        which allowed you to talk to your phone like Siri. 
        They even improved the placement of the fingerprint sensor on the phone.
